0,1045012052648112133,402282802,MoneyballMitch,I’ll never use @UPS @UPSHelp again in my life. Period. Told me I had a package coming between 12:45pm - 4:45pm. I take off work to be here. I get here at 12:15pm to a note on the door saying they tried to deliver at 11:37am. 🤬 https://t.co/v41bGKdqdD,Wed Sep 26 18:07:43 +0000 2018,0,0,008097920e218240,
