2,1043241106996187140,559477766,ContinueCommeCa,"@UPSHelp 2/2 ... And few other emails asking me again the parcel number. I‚Äôm around 65 emails on this parcel! So I asked the boutique to send me back my parcel by any other delivery company. I‚Äôm tired of #UPS and it‚Äôs local partners. Thanks again.

3,1043243187584819200,271516607,UPSHelp,@ContinueCommeCa Is this still in regards to the tracking number 21044532569362GB? I am showing that this package was delivered on 08/24. I am unable to confirm the address so if you do not have it that is because the sender has recieved it. ^QJ,Fri Sep 21 20:58:53 +0000 2018,0,0,,
4,1043249065050472454,559477766,ContinueCommeCa,"@UPSHelp And that‚Äôs the trouble. The totally silly think in this situation is that UPS ""last km"" partner in France (called IMX) pretended my address was wrong (which is totally wrong!) &amp; the parcel was sended back. Up to UPS to choose it‚Äôs partner. And to assume or not it‚Äôs responsibility",Fri Sep 21 21:22:14 +0000 2018,0,0,,
