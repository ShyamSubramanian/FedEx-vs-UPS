I was told there was nothing you can do because I couldn't provide an apartment number for my house.",Tue Sep 25 17:10:10 +0000 2018,0,0,,
2,1044637069392392192,402861722,EdwardLorn,"@UPSHelp Again, already did all that. You told me there was nothing you could do because the company who sent the package didn't update the address with the correct apartment number. Can't update an address when it's already correct.",Tue Sep 25 17:17:40 +0000 2018,0,0,,

Again, no way to update an address when the address was correct to begin with. I've gotten nothing but a runaround from your company, both on Twitter and locally. https://t.co/TMR104HNl0",Tue Sep 25 19:03:50 +0000 2018,0,0,,
4,1044671378312626177,402861722,EdwardLorn,@UPSHelp Local said the address needed to be updated by 911. 911 said the address is fine. Everyone is blaming everyone else and nothing's being done. USPS has no trouble finding me. I'm not DMing you so you can tell me you can't help me in private. I've played this game with you before.,Tue Sep 25 19:34:00 +0000 2018,0,0,,
