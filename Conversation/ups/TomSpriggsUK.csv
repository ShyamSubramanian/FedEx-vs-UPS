0,1044917923519844353,576399844,TomSpriggsUK,Oi @UPSHelp why didn’t your driver try KNOCKING or ringing the functional DOORBELL rather than wasting time filling this stupid form out? I’m sat here in ready for delivery. Now everyone has to go to the accesspoint. Why?? https://t.co/Dt6FTsSrEu,Wed Sep 26 11:53:41 +0000 2018,0,1,,

Please DM the tracking number, your address, and telephone number. We can also look in to getting the package redirected back to you. ^TV https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ",Wed Sep 26 12:08:00 +0000 2018,0,0,,
