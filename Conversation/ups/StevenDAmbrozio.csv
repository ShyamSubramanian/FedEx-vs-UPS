1,1044959528649981953,271516607,UPSHelp,@StevenDAmbrozio I understand your frustration. Drivers should be checking the addresses before leaving packages. Can you please DM me your tracking number along with your phone number? Please also confirm your address vs. the address where the driver is leaving them. ^ML https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ,Wed Sep 26 14:39:00 +0000 2018,0,0,,
