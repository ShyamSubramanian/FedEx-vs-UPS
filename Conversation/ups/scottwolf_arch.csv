0,1043132876575911937,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,Ugh looks like @UPS misrouted my Apple Watch. Can you help @UPSHelp,Fri Sep 21 13:40:32 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1043227962651369472,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,Looks like @UPS made up some stories about what happened and lied about when it would finally be available for pickup. When the delay is entirely UPS’s fault they should go above and beyond to make it right. There is no excuse.,Fri Sep 21 19:58:23 +0000 2018,0,0,,

3,1043231145058611200,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp Was sent to a facility only 15 minutes away. I could have driven there at lunch if someone had not lied and said it would be available in a few hours.,Fri Sep 21 20:11:01 +0000 2018,0,0,,
4,1043290394665070592,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp Still hasn’t moved 14 hours later. Somehow @UPS can get something from Asia to Florida in 35 hours but can’t get 20 miles in 14 hours. Also can’t even give an explanation what happened or any estimate when it will be delivered.,Sat Sep 22 00:06:28 +0000 2018,0,0,,
5,1043333636618153984,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp @UPS 16 hours later pancake is finally on its way somewhere. Assume @UPSHelp will be cheap and refuse Saturday delivery even though it was their mistake. Was told “sometime next week” after being told “by end of day”. Everyone made up their own story.,Sat Sep 22 02:58:17 +0000 2018,0,0,,

8,1043458781659754496,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp @UPS @AppleSupport @UPSHelp response by DM is to just “continue tracking” and hope by some apparent miracle it’s delivered on Saturday even though saver doesn’t have Saturday Delivery. It was @UPS fault and multiple lies in writing and by phone. #MakeItRight,Sat Sep 22 11:15:34 +0000 2018,0,0,,
9,1043500029590364161,271516607,UPSHelp,@scottwolf_arch I'm sorry for the frustration. I do see your package is loaded onto the car and you can expect the delivery by the end of the day today.

11,1043658270425137152,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp So what happened? It wasn’t delivered and the tracking has been altered after the fact so that it no longer shows loaded on delivery vehicle. Glad I took screenshots.,Sun Sep 23 00:28:16 +0000 2018,0,0,,
12,1043663491230511104,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp I waited around 2 days in a row since it’s a signature required package. Is @UPSHelp going to waist a third full day of my life due to incompetence? @AppleSupport,Sun Sep 23 00:49:01 +0000 2018,0,0,,
13,1043669612171276291,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp @AppleSupport @UPSHelp ignored my DM’s all day then realizes they didn’t read carefully and item was never out for delivery. #FAIL @AppleSupport you must be rethinking your relationship with @UPS after all this right?

14,1043676898684035072,771069349419442176,scottwolf_arch,@UPSHelp @AppleSupport @UPS And now claiming via DM they never said it was out for delivery even though tracking and public tweet said it was. Tracking history has actually been altered to no longer show it was out for delivery. Super deceptive on the part of @UPSHelp. Take a look @9to5mac,Sun Sep 23 01:42:17 +0000 2018,0,0,,
