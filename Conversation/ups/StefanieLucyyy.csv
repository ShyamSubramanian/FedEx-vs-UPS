Yet again, I have missed ANOTHER package! What happened to taking care of the customer?!",Wed Sep 26 19:08:28 +0000 2018,0,1,,

All this just to receive another call from my local facility saying “Nothing she can do and I have to wait til tomorrow.” 🤬🤬 this is a recurring problem I have at my home with UPS!",Wed Sep 26 21:35:26 +0000 2018,0,0,,
