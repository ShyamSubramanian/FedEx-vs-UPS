4,1043345205175365633,1901631,hegyessy,@UPS @UPSHelp BTW. The shipping address is correct. You show it in the My Choice portal. You put a nice little house on the map showing where I live. I’ve given my info to 3 service agents today. All before you changed the status to delivery address is incorrect.,Sat Sep 22 03:44:15 +0000 2018,0,0,18acb236ee34aaf4,

8,1044718753525587969,1901631,hegyessy,@DiegoAlamir @UPS @UPSHelp I never chose them as my delivery option. 1. They very rarely deliver when they say they will and 2. Their customer service is horrendous. Pretty sure I’m muted by them on Twitter.,Tue Sep 25 22:42:15 +0000 2018,0,0,45cadd6ef118ec9f,
