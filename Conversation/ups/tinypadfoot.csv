0,1044303913028145153,282442389,tinypadfoot,@UPSHelp what’s wrong with your UPS Mychoice service. I’ve been calling you about this issue for months and NO ONE can fix it! I have a package for my household member with the EXACT SAME ADDRESS listed on my account and you’re still saying it doesn’t match! It’s been months!,Mon Sep 24 19:13:49 +0000 2018,0,0,3a22597bb94d08bd,
