3,1045066600624336903,271516607,UPSHelp,@HustleGz I can understand how it can be frustrating waiting for a package. Your package is currently out for delivery. The commit time for the package is by end of day. This is typically 8 PM. The driver will be there as soon as possible. ^BO,Wed Sep 26 21:44:28 +0000 2018,0,0,,
