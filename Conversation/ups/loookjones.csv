0,1045033714030452737,150725669,loookjones,@UPSHelp I am livid. I had an expensive order due today and waited all day for it to come to be told at the last minute it was not arriving and had changed status to arriving tomorrow. After I'd had a text saying it was due today. What are you going to do to fix this?,Wed Sep 26 19:33:47 +0000 2018,0,3,,
