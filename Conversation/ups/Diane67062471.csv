5,1044613115378364417,271516607,UPSHelp,@Diane67062471 I can certainly see how this would be frustrating to not get this package that you were excited for. With this showing that a damage report was started you would want to remain in contact with the shipper as they will receive any updates on this damage report. ^AC,Tue Sep 25 15:42:29 +0000 2018,0,0,,
