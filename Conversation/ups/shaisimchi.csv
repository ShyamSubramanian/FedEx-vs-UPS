3,1044992019381116929,20969785,shaisimchi,@ups @UPSHelp - Yesterday - got message that my package delivery date is today. Changed to pick up at a UPS store not to miss it. Now delivery changed to tomorrow?!?! Why? And your customer support is useless if all it can do is read information I can read online. HELP PLEASE!,Wed Sep 26 16:48:07 +0000 2018,0,0,,

5,1044998909532069889,20969785,shaisimchi,@UPSHelp Well - it would have been great if this was communicated WHILE I was making the change online. The package is already there...now it just needs to sit there an extra day (a day I can't pick it up...),Wed Sep 26 17:15:29 +0000 2018,0,0,,
