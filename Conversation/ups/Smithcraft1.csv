Thanks Import Image Racing!

Day 1 - That's a nice parcel.
Day 2 - Damn! What's that doiing here? Put it on a plane!
Day 3 - Pick up from airport, sort, and deliver.

Is that so difficult?",Tue Sep 25 19:31:30 +0000 2018,0,0,,

Brown screwed me. UPS had 3 days to put it on a plane and send it to the other coast. Right now it's either being put on a train, or who knows what.

The CSR I spoke to said there were NO exceptions showing a reason for the parcel to be delayed",Tue Sep 25 20:00:48 +0000 2018,0,0,,
