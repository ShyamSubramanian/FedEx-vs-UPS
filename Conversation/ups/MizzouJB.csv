0,1044961656319758336,40318651,MizzouJB,@UPSHelp I received an email regarding “an important delivery from UPS Customer Service” with a link to download attachments. It seems legit since it’s from packageinfo@ups.com. Is it safe to open the attachments?,Wed Sep 26 14:47:27 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1044964819101765634,271516607,UPSHelp,@MizzouJB I can see how you would be concerned. Are you expecting a package? If you are enrolled in My Choice it could be an update for a package from that. You can also log in to your My Choice and check your calendar for packages coming to you. ^TV,Wed Sep 26 15:00:02 +0000 2018,0,0,,
