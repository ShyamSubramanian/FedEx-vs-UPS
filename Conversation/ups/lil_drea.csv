3,1043671657154371584,22682141,lil_drea,@westelm Really disappointed with your choice of using @UPS for delivery of my bed frame. They just delivered 1 of 3 boxes &amp; left it on the stairs. They did not deliver it to the front door. I guess “Front Door Delivery” is too difficult for them.,Sun Sep 23 01:21:28 +0000 2018,0,0,3b77caf94bfc81fe,
4,1043672912983728130,271516607,UPSHelp,"@lil_drea Hello Andrea, your disappointment that we delivered the package t the front gate; is understandable. Please use your My Choice ""Delivery Preference"" select ""Front Door"" delivery. When the driver scans the package your preference will come up. https://t.co/Er04aSsKEn ^LG https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ",Sun Sep 23 01:26:27 +0000 2018,0,0,,

6,1044644576722530305,22682141,lil_drea,@westelm Another reason why your company should not use @UPSHelp @UPS for delivery of furniture. They won’t deliver inside the house. Luckily they delivered before their time window &amp; I was still home. But now I have to try to get the pkgs into the house. 50+ lbs. https://t.co/QJqOxTlFd9,Tue Sep 25 17:47:30 +0000 2018,0,0,3b77caf94bfc81fe,
