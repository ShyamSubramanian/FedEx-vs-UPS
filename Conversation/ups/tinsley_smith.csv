Sadly, I think this is the 5th time I’ve complained. #lazy #ridiculous #tiredofit https://t.co/TdUtrEkoPa",Sat Aug 25 00:56:40 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1033162128159657986,408580672,tinsley_smith,@UPSHelp I’ve done this before. Nothing changes. She’s the same delivery driver who flies through our neighborhood and has no respect for peoples’ packages. We’ve dealt with this for over a year with her. She just doesn’t care.,Sat Aug 25 01:20:21 +0000 2018,0,0,,
