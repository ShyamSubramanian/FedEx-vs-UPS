3,1043299845623164929,106188704,ToniBaldwin,"@UPS sucks. If I pay for something to be delivered on a certain day, don't tell me it'll be delivered on that day until 30 minutes before the end of your day and then when I call, say I'll get it Monday...CLEARLY I needed it TODAY. https://t.co/NV5Owrm3CW",Sat Sep 22 00:44:01 +0000 2018,0,0,,
4,1043514971932569602,106188704,ToniBaldwin,Update the @UPS customer service lady lied and said they don‚Äôt make weekend deliveries just for UPS to guarantee a Saturday delivery...since they do Saturday deliveries lol. This is the most action I‚Äôve had getting a phone in my life. https://t.co/CNEwXqIm1y,Sat Sep 22 14:58:51 +0000 2018,0,0,,

6,1044705407288168450,106188704,ToniBaldwin,@UPSHelp Already resolved it. I bought my phone instead of waiting on you guys to deliver it because a Friday delivery is STILL delayed until tomorrow lol. Cancelled the order since 6 different people gave me 6 different locations on the same day. Terrible service. Absolutely AWFUL!,Tue Sep 25 21:49:13 +0000 2018,0,0,,
