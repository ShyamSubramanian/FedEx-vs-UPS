0,1044673384557109249,543752682,paigepbx,@ups lost my moms $1000 phone. They admitted to us that THEY changed the original address to an address that we lived at 3 years ago &amp; delivered it to a random person. Now they wonâ€™t help. How is that legal? What a shit show. They shouldnâ€™t be in business.ðŸ˜¡ #ShutDownUPS,Tue Sep 25 19:41:58 +0000 2018,0,3,,
