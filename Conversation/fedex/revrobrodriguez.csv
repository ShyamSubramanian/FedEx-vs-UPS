0,1044701753512538112,16329717,revrobrodriguez,@FedEx @FedExHelp unacceptable - I had to call you all to find out that your system is showing inaccurate info.  My whole week is now messed up because I won’t receive my items until a day later from what your REAL TIME tracking shows.  Why do you send an item to another state? https://t.co/JaSQMRGw3J,Tue Sep 25 21:34:42 +0000 2018,0,0,dd9c503d6c35364b,

I think it’s ridiculous that your system is displaying wrong info. when you’re a billion-dollar company and you messed up my entire week’s schedule.",Tue Sep 25 21:42:50 +0000 2018,0,0,dd9c503d6c35364b,
