FedEx saying no lost package case can be opened. Handed the parcel to the driver over 2 weeks ago. Do I just let an expensive box go missing???",Wed Jan 24 18:49:40 +0000 2018,0,0,,

2,1044342802904227840,952293073,FedExHelp,@wearawishbone @wearawishbone: Have you checked at the front desk with a name similar to J. Lynch? It is extremely important that our drivers do get a signature since that is what the sender requested. Send also your phone # and verify your address please!
