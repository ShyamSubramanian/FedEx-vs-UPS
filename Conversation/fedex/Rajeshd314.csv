It's been one month we imported a consignment.  It's still at bang customs.  No update from FedEx.
Can't believe this kind of a worst service from FedEx.

It would have been better if he hadn't called.  I would still have some respect for FedEx.  
His way of handling this delay and his arrogance, unbelievable. https://t.co/EYqta5bZX6",Fri Sep 14 06:48:26 +0000 2018,0,0,,
