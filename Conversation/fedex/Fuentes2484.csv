0,1042904917629911041,115687832,Fuentes2484,@NFLSTORE_WO I ordered two @browns jerseys from you guys on Sunday. @FedEx was supposed to deliver it but I guess @USPS actually delivered it. Well it went to the wrong address by accident and the lady gave my package to a @FedEx driver. It’s lost now. #wtf #out200bucks #nohelp,Thu Sep 20 22:34:43 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1042905465263480839,115687832,Fuentes2484,@NFLSTORE_WO @FedEx why would I ever use this service again? We have been looking forward to these jerseys just in time for game day. And now my jerseys are lost and neither @fedex or @USPS knows where they are. I used the same billing a shipping info on @NFLStore_ARG website,Thu Sep 20 22:36:53 +0000 2018,0,0,,
2,1042906190764822528,115687832,Fuentes2484,How was @NFLSTORE_WO able to accept my payment from my @usbank @Visa but not ship it to the correct address?! So I am just out of $213 now? @FedEx or @USPS can anyone help me? @NFLSTORE_WO has been absolutely no help. Their advice was to BUY TWO MORE JERSEYS and wait for a refund,Thu Sep 20 22:39:46 +0000 2018,0,0,,
