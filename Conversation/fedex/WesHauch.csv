3,1029121601495883776,465094933,WesHauch,FWIW guitar buds - Don’t ship or insure with @FedEx. Some of you saw the pictures of the guitar that they damaged in shipping. They recently denied the insurance claim we put through. The claims process was murky and hard to navigate as well. Don’t waste your time or money.,Mon Aug 13 21:44:44 +0000 2018,23,154,,
