0,1044708623061061634,28389123,Veruca72,In this day &amp; age of media accessibility one would think a group as large as @FedEx would actually deliver on time. Thanks for ruining my company launch. Package is *only* 3 days late. And now the (expected) run around had been dispensed by employees who don't know jack.,Tue Sep 25 22:02:00 +0000 2018,0,1,,

2,1044714249749229569,28389123,Veruca72,@FedExHelp There's no help available. All I'll get is my $31shipping. Event is ruined. It starts in 35 min &amp; my package still is not delivered. Y'all just called me - after 3 calls in to you - to tell me....wait for it...that my PACKAGE IS ON THE TRUCK FOR DELIVERY TODAY. LOL. #Derp,Tue Sep 25 22:24:21 +0000 2018,0,0,,

All my branded shirts, hats, uniforms &amp; logo'd hand outs and brochures are in that package. Red hot mad. Screwing the little guy once again. I should have used @UPS .",Tue Sep 25 22:26:35 +0000 2018,0,0,,
