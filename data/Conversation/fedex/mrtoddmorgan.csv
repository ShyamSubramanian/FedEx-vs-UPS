0,1043628773420208129,82286576,mrtoddmorgan,@FedEx claims they attempted a delivery to my house. Nope. We have a room full of people by the door all of which know of the package. @fedex support was useless. Have to wait til Tuesday. Unacceptable. Your driver never attempted the delivery!,Sat Sep 22 22:31:03 +0000 2018,0,0,,
