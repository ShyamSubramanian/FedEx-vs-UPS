0,1044321693005754373,379004081,feedingtubepaul,@FedExHelp Why don't you follow delivery instructions. I'm sick &amp; tired of you not delivering my packages. Even a sign on neighbors door. You once again didn't deliver to me and I have a delivery note. Turn your truck around &amp; deliver to me &amp; not my neighbor. Usually my med stuff https://t.co/292gNOSD6n,Mon Sep 24 20:24:28 +0000 2018,0,0,,
