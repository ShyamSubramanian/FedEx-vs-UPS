5,1044356707479158785,952293073,FedExHelp,"@ssbu_Grylvak @ssbu_Grylvak Nick Hi, thanks for the tweet. I do understand. The merchant (business) should most likely initiate a (damage) claim on this package if the product is damaged or unusable. If they are proceeding through the appropriate channels this would be the best recourse.
