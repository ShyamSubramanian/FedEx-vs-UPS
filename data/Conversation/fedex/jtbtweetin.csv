The question is, can I recieve a refund, discount, or credit for the misaligned/crooked print job that employees were unable to fix bc of technical issues? It was completed at the Fedex store.",Mon Sep 24 22:44:37 +0000 2018,0,0,,
3,1044359649493946368,952293073,FedExHelp,@jtbtweetin @jtbtweetin: You would definitely want to get a refund at that particular store if not up to satisfaction! Is there a manager at store you could talk with? Hopefully all will be great and they'll take care of you.,Mon Sep 24 22:55:18 +0000 2018,0,0,,

I have my receipt and order info, just not the helpful Fedex team members.",Mon Sep 24 22:57:13 +0000 2018,0,0,,
