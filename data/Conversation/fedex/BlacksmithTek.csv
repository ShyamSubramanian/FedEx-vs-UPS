3,1044296974831427584,952293073,FedExHelp,@BlacksmithTek I apologize the packages are not available. What happens is when a package arrives to the destination before the committed time they are not unloaded from the trucks. This is the reason the station would not allow you to pick them up. I truly apologize for the inconvenience.,Mon Sep 24 18:46:15 +0000 2018,0,0,,
