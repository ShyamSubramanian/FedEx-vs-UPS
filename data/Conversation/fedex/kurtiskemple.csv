0,1043469502380494848,1056152730,kurtiskemple,I'm so tired of paying for 2 day shipping only to have @FedEx not deliver on time. The last FOUR FedEx packages I've received have been at least a day late. I only do two day shipping when I really need something. I honestly wish all companies would use @UPS instead. ðŸ˜¡,Sat Sep 22 11:58:10 +0000 2018,0,3,0427846a106c0bd9,
