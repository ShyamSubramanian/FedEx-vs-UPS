Okay, that’s fine. Then it was out for delivery today at 2:46am - waited all day. Changed to pending at 6pm - wth? https://t.co/9HZiBof9pL",Wed Sep 26 01:58:42 +0000 2018,1,1,,

I partially blame @Apple - I don’t know why they shipped one package out with the more reliable @UPS and then ship the 2nd with shoddy @FedEx",Wed Sep 26 03:39:53 +0000 2018,1,1,,
