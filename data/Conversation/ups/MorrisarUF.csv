Perfectly acceptable though, according to #Apple and #UPS.",Tue Sep 25 18:07:05 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1044652685612503040,271516607,UPSHelp,@MorrisarUF I know how frustrating it can be to have a package delayed that you have been waiting on. We are working on getting these shipments delivered as quickly as possible. ^AC,Tue Sep 25 18:19:43 +0000 2018,0,0,,
2,1044771023860699136,3135254187,MorrisarUF,@UPSHelp Problem isn't frustration. It's that @UPS promises guaranteed time-in-transit times with #UPS World Ease and doesn't deliver. What message does that send to businesses? And @Apple promises that #iPhoneXS will arrive on the release date. What message does that send to customers? https://t.co/mtAo6cpvOd,Wed Sep 26 02:09:57 +0000 2018,0,1,,
