Why couldn’t you do that the same day you tried to deliver my package?",Sun Sep 23 13:46:01 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1043866454221819905,271516607,UPSHelp,@powlovemx I understand your concerns and most of the time with the volume that a driver carries they are unable to deliver to the access point the same day. Normally the delivery takes place on the next business day.^QJ,Sun Sep 23 14:15:31 +0000 2018,0,0,,
2,1044750907819286528,896423391875538944,powlovemx,@UPSHelp I got out of work early to pick up my package at your access point and was told my the owner that they had to close early and couldn’t help me. I’m not sure why you have official store hours if they are not followed. I should have received my package Friday.,Wed Sep 26 00:50:01 +0000 2018,0,0,,
