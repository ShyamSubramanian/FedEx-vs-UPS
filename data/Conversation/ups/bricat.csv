They say my package which is due today has been rescheduled with no available date and the best they can do is to tell me to keep checking online.,Tue Sep 25 21:11:19 +0000 2018,0,2,c3f37afa9efcf94b,

3,1044699711121371138,18638847,bricat,@UPSHelp It supposedly was leaving China on 9/21 according to my tracking page. Are you telling me that @ups misreports tracking info?,Tue Sep 25 21:26:35 +0000 2018,0,1,c3f37afa9efcf94b,
4,1044703556941619202,18638847,bricat,@ups @UPSHelp 3 different people talked to with 3 very different answers. The last being “no one can ever give you a scheduled date for an international delivery until it reaches the US”.  What a load of crap! Tell your employees to stop making up lies. @apple Please use @FedEx!,Tue Sep 25 21:41:52 +0000 2018,0,1,c3f37afa9efcf94b,
