When the shipment comes in late and just misses the truck going out for delivery we are always able to pick up at the depot.  Obviously FedEx employee is unwilling to get the package for us and make it ready for pick up today at depot .Time to move to @UPSHelp ???,Tue Sep 25 19:04:15 +0000 2018,0,0,,
