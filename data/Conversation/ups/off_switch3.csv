4 days after the right delivery date, I STILL don't have the iPhone I pre-ordered, and it's DELAYED AGAIN!! I could have walked into a store any time in the past 4 days and bought one, WTF was the point of a pre-order. https://t.co/iIYansWTqp",Tue Sep 25 12:55:43 +0000 2018,0,1,,

How can be stuck in customs for so long, miss a flight and now delayed for unknown reasons. It's almost like they don't know what they're doing",Tue Sep 25 15:40:17 +0000 2018,0,0,,
