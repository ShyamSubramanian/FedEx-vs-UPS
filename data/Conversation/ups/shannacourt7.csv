When I call customer service last night at 9:30 PM I was told my driver was still out delivering. When are you going to admit my package is lost so @Apple can start an investigation? https://t.co/VxtQpu9VhZ,Sun Sep 23 14:11:28 +0000 2018,0,0,,

Was promised by @UPSHelp that I could pick up the pkg today but then called and told it was out for delivery. Can anyone @UPS tell me where the pkg is? I’ve already had a UPS delivery today, so I doubt it’s coming today. https://t.co/bZMXBd6RcZ",Mon Sep 24 22:22:57 +0000 2018,0,0,,
