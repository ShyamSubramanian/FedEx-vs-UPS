1,1044343612014653440,2958738522,howlingthunder,@UPS @UPSHelp My package was supposed to be delivered between 10-2. Then it changed to 3. Now it changed to “End-Of-Day”. Why even tell me an estimated delivery time when you can’t honor it? This is a business package that I will now no longer receive during business hours.,Mon Sep 24 21:51:34 +0000 2018,0,0,,

Please DM the tracking number, your phone number and confirmation of the delivery address to my team so, we can assist you. ^RN https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ",Mon Sep 24 22:11:50 +0000 2018,0,0,,
