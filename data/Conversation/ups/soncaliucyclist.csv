0,1042439932936110080,188946121,soncaliucyclist,Come on @UPS @UPSHelp_UK one of your access points just rejected my parcel because of its size! What is the 'point' of an access point if it can't take parcels? And moreover surely this sort of info should be known upfront when choosing an access point. Parcel now delayed ðŸ˜¡,Wed Sep 19 15:47:02 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1042442804461494272,271516607,UPSHelp,@soncaliucyclist I can certainly see how this would be frustrating to not have this package able to be delivered to an access point. Those access points do have restrictions on certain packages that they are able to receive. If you need us to look into this please DM us. ^AC,Wed Sep 19 15:58:26 +0000 2018,0,0,,
2,1042447875727400962,188946121,soncaliucyclist,@UPSHelp How do we know which restrictions apply to which access points? Surely an unsuitable access point should not be selectable for a given package anyway?,Wed Sep 19 16:18:35 +0000 2018,0,0,,
3,1042477928234274816,271516607,UPSHelp,"@soncaliucyclist Sorry for the confusion. All access points have the same guidelines for receiving packages. If a package is too big, requires a signature, or the access point is full - they are not able to accept. DM our team the tracking #, name, &amp; delivery address to review your options. ^TT https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ",Wed Sep 19 18:18:01 +0000 2018,0,0,,
