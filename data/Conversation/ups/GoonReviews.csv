0,1043269485812240384,261798240,GoonReviews,Third day in a row @UPS that you said that a package was attempted to be delivered and it wasn't. I literally sat and watched out the window during the time it said it was attempted to be delivered. Way to lie to customers.,Fri Sep 21 22:43:23 +0000 2018,0,1,,

3,1044837997387165697,261798240,GoonReviews,"@UPSHelp This had nothing to do with communication, but everything to do with being dishonest and lazy to your customers. A supervisor called me and said the package would be delivered Thurs (and Fri if I wasn't home) and it wasn't delivered either day.",Wed Sep 26 06:36:05 +0000 2018,0,0,,

So not only did I lose money leaving work early two days in a row to try and catch your driver, I lost money invested in the convention because I had no product to demo.",Wed Sep 26 06:38:20 +0000 2018,0,0,,

I, for the life of me, cannot understand how you are in business.",Wed Sep 26 06:42:29 +0000 2018,0,0,,
