You deliver packages from this same shipper multiple times a week and today my package is nowhere to be found. I was home all day and my dog hates delivery men. What gives?,Fri Sep 14 03:10:23 +0000 2018,0,0,,

2,1041686084386734082,271516607,UPSHelp,@shoewhoreninja The investigation is still open on the package and UPS is currently looking for the shipment. You will need to keep in contact with the shipper as any claim details will be sent directly to them. So you know an investigation can take up to eight business days. ^ML https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ,Mon Sep 17 13:51:30 +0000 2018,0,0,,

Maybe try harder, ups... I feel like you’ve just washed your hands of this. #disappointed",Tue Sep 25 16:35:02 +0000 2018,0,0,,
7,1044629219563761665,271516607,UPSHelp,@shoewhoreninja I apologize that you feel that way. We don't receive notification on our end of the results. That is sent by our investigation team directly to the shipper recorded on the investigation. I suggest having them contact us directly if they have not been notified. ^ZM,Tue Sep 25 16:46:28 +0000 2018,0,0,,
