You had to deliver a package as well today so you just dropped it off outside along with the labels instead of ringing the bell? (Which works, I checked) #doyourjob",Tue Sep 25 23:56:53 +0000 2018,0,1,,
1,1044738492599816193,32455612,mozartianme,@UPSHelp your guy never made it to my apt to pick up packages yesterday. You had a package to deliver as well today so instead of ringing/knocking you left it outside with the labels on the floor and say you “attempted”. Your incompetence is causing me undue stress. #sopissed,Wed Sep 26 00:00:41 +0000 2018,0,0,,
2,1044739322510024705,32455612,mozartianme,Dear @UPSHelp @UPS @USPS @USPSHelp please train your team to ACTUALLY find out if there’s anyone home. Don’t just throw/slide packages 10 ft away from where the actual door is in an apartment complex. Don’t leave notices pretending you “attempted”. #doyourjob,Wed Sep 26 00:03:59 +0000 2018,0,0,,

5,1045086913978347520,32455612,mozartianme,@Music_Fan5555 @UPSHelp This makes me mad. I’ve been waiting for the 3rd day in a row for driver to pick up packages. They just left a package outside my apt last night without attempting to knock or ring and then said they “attempted“. LIES AND INCOMPETENCE,Wed Sep 26 23:05:11 +0000 2018,0,0,,

7,1045087248339922944,32455612,mozartianme,@Music_Fan5555 @UPSHelp I even made signs for them so they KNOW I’ve been waiting for them. I was off this week. But NOBODY should have to wait around for 72 hours and STILL have zero expected results!,Wed Sep 26 23:06:31 +0000 2018,0,0,,
