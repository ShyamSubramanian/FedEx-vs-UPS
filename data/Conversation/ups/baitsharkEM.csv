0,1044980040461635584,2943154259,baitsharkEM,UPS hub destroyed my package. Refuses to pay for contents even though it was fully insured through UPS store. UPS store and UPS point fingers at each other. Disservice to customer. @UPS @UPSHelp @UPS_News #ups,Wed Sep 26 16:00:31 +0000 2018,0,0,,
1,1044980362961723392,2943154259,baitsharkEM,This has been over a 6 month ordeal. UPS lies and deceives in order to weasel their way out of compensation. One of my favorite lies: “Water damaged the package.” Water can’t bend metal and there wasn’t water in the package. @UPS @UPSHelp @UPS_News #ups,Wed Sep 26 16:01:47 +0000 2018,0,0,,

At one point a UPS store corporate employee yelled, “We are not in the business of reimbursements!” Not in the business of intact packages, either. @UPS @UPSHelp @UPS_News #ups",Wed Sep 26 16:02:25 +0000 2018,0,0,,
